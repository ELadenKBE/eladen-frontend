# Eladen Frontend

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14.0 or higher)
- npm (v7.0 or higher)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>` or download the project files as a ZIP archive and extract them to a local directory.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

## Starting the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:
`npm run dev`

This command will start the development server on **http://127.0.0.1:5173/** and automatically reload the page when changes are made to the code.

## Building the Project

To build the project for production, run the following command:
`npm run build`

This command will create a production-ready build of the project in the dist directory. The **dist** directory will contain the compiled JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files that make up the application.

## Deploying the Built Files to a Server

To deploy the built files to a server, copy the contents of the dist directory to the server using your preferred method. You can use FTP, SCP, or any other file transfer protocol that your server supports. Once the files have been transferred, they should be accessible on the server via the web.
